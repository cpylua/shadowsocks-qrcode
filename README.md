# What

A cli tool to generate QR code image from shadowsocks json config file. You can
use it without a network connection :)

# Why

I don't want to use online services because shadowsocks configurations are
sensitive.

# Usage

`node ./index.js path-to-shaodowsocks-json-config-file`

You will see the QR code in the terminal.
